Vault Hunters Jewel Calculator

The Vault Hunters Jewel Calculator is a Windows application that helps you calculate the best combination of jewels to use based on their size and value.

How It Works
The application allows you to add jewels by specifying their name, size, and value. You can enter this information in the provided text fields and click the "Craft" button to add the jewel to the list. The list of jewels you've added will be displayed in the application's main window.
You can also delete selected jewels from the list by clicking the "Delete" button. To copy the selected jewels to the clipboard, click the "Copy" button. If you have jewels in your clipboard, you can paste this into the application by clicking the "Paste" button. The copy and paste function is intended to save the jewels you have into for example a text file so when you want to calculate again you don’t have to renter all the jewels again.
To calculate the best combination of jewels, enter the maximum tool space available in the "Max Space" text field and click the "Calculate" button. The application will find the best jewels to use based on their size, value, and the available space. The result, including the jewels to add and the total value and size, will be displayed in the application's main window.

How To Use
1.	Launch the application by running the executable file.
2.	Enter the jewel information (name, size, and value) in the corresponding text fields. (For value if 2.1 does no work try 2,1 instead)
3.	Click the "Craft" button to add the jewel to the list.
4.	Repeat steps 2-3 to add more jewels as needed.
5.	To delete jewels, select them then click the "Delete" button.
6.	To copy selected jewels to the clipboard, click the "Copy" button.
7.	To paste jewels from the clipboard, click the "Paste" button.
8.	Enter the maximum tool space available in the "Max Space" text field.
9.	Click the "Calculate" button to find the best combination of jewels.
10.	The best jewels to add, as well as the total value and size, will be displayed in the application's window.

Note
This application is designed for Windows operating systems.
This application is made in around 4 hours, so it’s not perfect.
